# PragmARC
The PragmAda Reusable Components

This is a public repository of the PragmAda Reusable Components (PragmARCs), duplicating the .zip files at the PragmAda web site (https://pragmada.x10hosting.com).

The default branch is Ada-07, the version using features of ISO/IEC 8652:2007. There is also branch master, the Ada-95 version.

The actual license is the GNAT-Modified GPL (GMGPL), which allows the use of these components in proprietary software. GitHub does not provide that as a choice in its drop-down. The license is included in every source file.
